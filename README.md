# IPL_DataAnalysis
In this repository, I've used various libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn to perform a basic statistical data analysis on
The Indian Premiere League from 2008 to 2019.

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India contested during March or April and May of every year by eight teams
representing eight different cities in India.The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2008.
The IPL has an exclusive window in ICC Future Tours Programme.
